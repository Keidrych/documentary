### Tables Display

To describe method arguments in a table, but prepare them in a more readable format, `documentary` will parse the code blocks with `table` language as a table. The blocks must be in `JSON` format and contain a single array of arrays which represent rows.

````m
```t–∞ble
[
  ["arg", "description"],
  ["-f", "Display only free domains"],
  ["-z", "A list of zones to check"],
]
```
````

Result:

| arg | description |
| --- | ----------- |
| -f | Display only free domains |
| -z | A list of zones to check |
