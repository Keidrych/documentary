#Â Hello World!

Documentation generator written in Node.JS.

## Introduction

_Documentary_ allows to create [tables of contents](t)
that are used for navigation. It can also place visual
separators known as [section breaks](t).

## CLI

To generate [wiki](t), use the `-W` command. With the
addition of `--focus {Page}` (`-f`), only _Documentary_
will [focus](####) on the exact page.

<!-- using #### will make focus appear under wiki -->
