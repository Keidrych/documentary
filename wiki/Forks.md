When placing examples, it is important to show the output that they produce. This can be achieved using the `FORK` marker.

```t
%[/!_]FORK(-lang)? module ...args%
```

Listing [[examples|Embed-Examples]] and forking source code in documentation, gives another layer of **Quality Assurance** of the program, since after the compilation of the README file, any errors due to introduced changes to the source code will appear there. In fact, in some cases, documentation-driven development can even substitute tests.

%~%

The `%FORK%` marker will make _Documentary_ fork a _Node.JS_ module using the `child_process.fork` function. The output is printed in a code block, with optionally given language. If the process cleared lines with `\r`, the output will be adjusted to account for that to be displayed like it would be in the terminal. The environment variables will be inherited from the parent `doc` process.

## Stderr

By default, the `FORK` marker will print the `stdout` output. To print the `stderr` output, there is the `FORKERR` marker.

```t
%FORKERR(-lang)? module ...args%
```

It works exactly the same as `%FORK%` but will print the output of the process's `stderr` stream.

## Caching

The output of forks will be cached in the `.documentary/cache` directory. When compiling documentation, _Documentary_ will check for the presence of cache, check the _mtime_ of the module and if it is the same as cached, analyse module's dependencies to see if any of them had changes (updates to package dependencies' versions, changes to source files).

When the cache is matched, no forking will take place and the value will be taken from the saved outputs. To explicitly prevent caching on a particular _FORK_ marker, it should be prefixed with `!`: `%!FORK module arg1 arg2%`. To disable caching across all _forks_, the [`-c`](CLI#disable-cache) option can be passed to the CLI. In this case, even though caching was disabled, the new output will still be written to cache so that when _Documentary_ is run next time, the latest known output is placed instantly.

## Import/Exports Support

_Documentary_ is able to fork modules that use `import` and `export` without the developer having to write a proxy file that would otherwise require `@babel/register` or other runtime transpilers. It was made possible with a simple [_Ã€LaMode_](https://github.com/a-la/alamode) regex-based transpiler that will update the `import/export` statements on-the-fly. If there are any problems while using this feature, it can be disabled with the _plain_ `_` symbol: `%_FORK module arg1 arg2%`.

## Replace Absolute Paths

With the <kbd>/</kbd> prefix in the FORK command, all absolute paths that contain the current working directory, will be replaced with relative paths.

```
%/FORKERR-table example/print-table%
```

This can help with documenting errors or other code that prints absolute paths in a nimble way.

%/_FORKERR-js example/fork/absolute%

## `<fork>`

The `<fork>` component is the same as the `%FORK%` marker, but it offers extended functionality. The optional properties described above on this page are specified in the arguments, and the location of the fork module is passed as a child.

```jsx
<fork nocache plain relative stderr lang="js" 
  env="ENV_VAR=testing SECRET_KEY=hello-world">
  module/location/run.js
</fork>
```

%~%

## Env Variables

All environment variables will be inherited from the _Documentary_ process. Additional variables can be passed in the `env` argument, which is only available for the `<fork>` component and not the `%FORK%` marker. The variables will be split by whitespace, and the key-value pairs will be split by `=`. It's not possible to specify values with `=` in them at the moment.

%~%

## CLI Answers

If the fork interacts with the _CLI_ via the `stdin` interface, it is possible to write answers which will be entered when the fork's output (either `stdout` or `stderr`) is matched against the regular expression given in the answer.

_For example, the following README can be written:_
%EXAMPLE: example/fork/answers.md, html%

_And this is the source code of the fork:_
%EXAMPLE: test/fixture/fork-comp%

The output:

<fork lang="js">
  <answer regex="Are you sure">yes</answer>
  <answer regex="Please confirm">no</answer>
  <answer stderr regex="STDERR">documentary 123</answer>
  test/fixture/fork-comp.js
</fork>

Above, both answers to stdout are printed, and the answer to stderr, however because it is the fork of STDOUT only, stderr questions and user-supplied answer to it is not shown.

> At the moment, the answers are not cached, so if they change, documentation must be compiled again with `-c` (or `plain` argument).
