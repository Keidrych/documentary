<!-- ### VS Code Settings

It might be confusing to have a source and output `README.md` file, therefore to prevent errors, the following snippet can be used to hide the compiled file from VS Code search (update the `.vscode/settings.json` file):

```json
{
  "search.exclude": {
    "**/README.md": true
  }
}
``` -->
