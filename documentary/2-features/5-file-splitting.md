## **File Splitting**

_Documentary_ can read a directory and put files together into a single `README` file. The files will be sorted in alphabetical order, and their content merged into a single stream. The `index.md` and `footer.md` are special in this respect, such that the `index.md` of a directory will always go first, and the `footer.md` will go last. To print in reverse order, for example when writing a blog and name files by their dates, the [`--reverse` flag](#reverse-order) can be passed to the CLI.

Example structure used in this documentation:
