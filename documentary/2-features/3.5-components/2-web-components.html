<h3>Web Components</h3>

To receive access to the autosuggestions powered by _VSCode's_ `customData` implementation of web-components.json standard, documentation files need to be written in HTML file format, and the `.vscode/settings.json` has to be updated to include the `html.experimental.customData` property as shown below:

```json5
{
  "html.experimental.customData": [
    "./node_modules/documentary/web-components.json"
  ]
}
```

Then, _Documentary_'s components will be available when pressing CMD + SPACE in the editor.

```html
<shell command="echo" language="fs">
  HELLO WORLD!
  EXAMPLE !@£
</shell>
```

<shell command="echo" language="fs">
  HELLO WORLD!
  EXAMPLE !@£
</shell>
