## **Embedding Output**

When placing examples, it is important to show the output that they produce. This can be achieved using the `FORK` marker.

```t
%[/!_]FORK(-lang)? module ...args%
```

It will make _Documentary_ fork a _Node.JS_ module using the `child_process.fork` function. The output is printed in a code block, with optionally given language. If the process cleared lines with `\r`, the output will be adjusted to account for that to be displayed like it would be in the terminal. The environment variables will be inherited from the parent `doc` process.

### Stderr

By default, the `FORK` marker will print the `stdout` output. To print the `stderr` output, there is the `FORKERR` marker.

```t
%FORKERR(-lang)? module ...args%
```

It works exactly the same as `%FORK%` but will print the output of the process's `stderr` stream.

### Caching

The output of forks will be cached in the `.documentary/cache` directory. When compiling documentation, _Documentary_ will check for the presence of cache, check the _mtime_ of the module and if it is the same as cached, analyse module's dependencies to see if any of them had changes (updates to package dependencies' versions, changes to source files). When the cache is matched, no forking will take place and the value will be taken from the saved outputs. To explicitly prevent caching on a particular _FORK_ marker, it should be prefixed with `!`: `%!FORK module arg1 arg2%`. To disable caching across all _forks_, the [`-c`](#disable-cache) option can be passed to the CLI. Even if cache is disabled, the output will be saved so that when _Documentary_ is run next time, the latest known output is placed instantly.

### Import/Exports Support

_Documentary_ is able to fork modules that use `import` and `export` without the developer having to write a proxy file that would otherwise require `@babel/register`. It was made possible with _Ã€LaMode_ regex-based transpiler that will update the `import/export` statements on-the-fly. If there are any problems while using this feature, it can be disabled with the `_` symbol: `%_FORK module arg1 arg2%`.

### Replace Absolute Paths

With the <kbd>/</kbd> prefix in the FORK command, all absolute paths that contain the current working directory, will be replaced with relative paths.

```
%/FORKERR-table example/print-table%
