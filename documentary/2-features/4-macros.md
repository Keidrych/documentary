## **Macros**

When there this a need to present some data in a repeatable format, macros can be used. First, a macro needs to be defined with the `MACRO` rule, and then referenced by the `USE-MACRO` rule.

%EXAMPLE example/macro/index.md, markdown%
%FORK-markdown src/bin/alamode example/macro/index.md%

The data will be substituted with into `$N` placeholders using the `<data>` elements found.

> Currently, a macro can only be defined in the same file as its usage. Also, in future, macros will improve my allowing to use named placeholders.
