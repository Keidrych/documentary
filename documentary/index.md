_Documentary_ is a command-line tool to manage documentation of _Node.JS_ packages of any size. Due to the fact that there is usually a lot of manual labour involved in creating and keeping up-to-date a README document, such as copying examples and the output they produce, there is a need for software that can help automate the process and focus on what is really important, i.e., documenting the features. _Documentary_ serves as a pre-processor of documentation and enhances every area of the task of making available quality docs for Node.JS (and other languages) packages for fellow developers.

```sh
yarn add -D documentary
```
