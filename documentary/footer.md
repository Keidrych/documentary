## Glossary

- **[Online Documentation](t)**: documentation which is accessible online, such as on a GitHub website, or a language reference, e.g., [Node.js Documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html).
- **[Editor Documentation](t)**: hints available to the users of an IDE, or an editor, in form of suggestions and descriptive hints on hover over variables' names.

## TODO

- [ ] Test using `zoroaster`'s masks.
- [ ] Gather all types across the whole documentation first to be able to independently link them even if they are in separate files.
- [ ] Replace the source in example with a `require` call in addition to `import` statement.
- [ ] Implement caching.
- [ ] Trigger compilation whenever an embedded example changes.
